This project contains a series of IDL routines (.pro files) which are documented in an HTML file named after the project.

Installation recommendation: copy all routines contained in this project
- in a folder accessible by IDL, or
- in a new folder and edit the IDL PATH to include the directory address to that new folder in its list of places to search for routines.

To update the IDL PATH, within the IDLDE (workbench) environment,
- Select the 'Preferences' item in 'IDL' main menu
- Click on the 'IDL' item to show the submenu
- Select 'Path' to show the current IDL Path and verify that it includes the folder or add the directory address to that new folder.
- Select 'Apply' and then 'End' to complete the IDL Path update.

These IDL routines will then automatically be available for use in your own programs.
